# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease using the UCI dataset based on clinical features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and chest pain. The goal is to build a machine learning model to support early diagnosis by detecting patterns linked to heart disease.


Mainly implementing and comparing three supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These models are trained on the dataset and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

In the field of Healthcare, FN ( False Negatives ) category is the most harmful prediction because these can be fatal therefore weights can be assigned to the respective metrices.<br>
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ )

<h3>üìñ Academic Context:</h3>
This mini-project was developed as part of B.tech/CS-653 at UoL, demonstrating core machine learning concepts from data preprocessing to model deployment.<br>
